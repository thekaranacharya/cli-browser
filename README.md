# cli-browser
A text-based web browser with a Command Line Interface

About:

Sometimes you need to read online documentation or find something on the Internet from the command line or terminal. 
So, using Python to create a text-based browser! Retrieval of only text from your desired web-page right on to your command line and also storing each web page into seperate files in a common directory.

Implemented the following concepts :

1. Retrieval & Storage of web-pages using File operations I/O
2. Emulating the 'back' button of a browser using stack
3. Web scraping : HTML parsing using the beautifulsoup4 library
4. Text formatting using the colorama library
5. Understood system directory and file structure.
